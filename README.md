# EXPRORER
**EXPRORER** (**EX**tended **PRO**bes set construction by **RE**presentative **R**etrieval) is 
a systematic procedure to construct a set of cosolvent for drug discovery.

This repository consists of two parts:
- **cosolvent_generation**
  - For generation of cosolvent structures
- **scp_solver**
  - A minimum set cover problem solver based on [1]
  - For construction of cosolvent sets
